### PROJECT DETAILS

Using Python and its libraries, I gathered data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assessed its quality and tidiness, then cleaned it. Some analyses and visualizations were also carried out. The dataset that I wrangled and analyzed is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
